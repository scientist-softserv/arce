        <p> Did you ever speak to your parents, or your father and your mother, about relocation and

    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Not talked a lot. I think they just got tired of Wisconsin, I guess. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>
        <p> What was the problem back there? </p>

        <p> No jobs, I guess. </p>

    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>
        <p> He had been in the army, though, right? Did he have any training or a trade that he
            could [unclear]? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Yeah, they put him behind a desk, but I guess he didn’t like that. He did that, like,
            sixteen years. He regrets that now. Only it made us a living because he wanted out. They
            put him behind a desk pushing a pencil. He didn’t want to do that. All those
            battlefields he went to, of course, everybody wanted to hear the war stories, and he
            could tell a story. I mean, he wouldn’t talk to us, but when he’s drinking, then he’ll
            talk. He said he went through hell. He said, “I just got [unclear].” It was rough on
            them. A lot men that went in there, a lot of them, they didn’t come back. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>
        <p> So he didn’t really have a trade then, really, did he, other than maybe clerical work,
            filing and typing? <milestone unit="timestamp" start="0:05:06.7"/>
        </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Yeah, in the army. Well, recruiting. I guess that’s what he was doing, but he got tired
            of that. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>
        <p> So you decided to come out to California. So did you and your family actually come out
            on the relocation program through BIA [Bureau of Indian Affairs]? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">

            did you live in? </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> What parts of town? Used to live out on 25 and Hoover. I remember that pretty good.
            1963, ’62, that’s when the [Watts] Riots broke out, 25th and Hoover. Of course, they
            tore it down, but I remember that, 25th and Hoover. </p>

        <p> Belmont High School, 1971. I was seventeen years old then. I remember that, but I
            started drinking and party, whatever. Had to drop out. My dad took me over there. “Bring
            your dad or somebody with you.” I got way behind. There was no way I could catch up, so
            I had to do continuation, but I didn’t do that either. That was a big thing in those
            days. </p>

            remember. It was the late seventies, I guess. [unclear] over here on Pico in Westlake.
            So I go there. My brother was in there. They’re telling me I was alcoholic. I didn’t
            want to hear it. They said, “Oh, doing this program helps,” just like he was, but he
            started going to prison then in [unclear]. He ended up twice. Used to go visit him.
            [unclear]. “Oh, that’s what I hear.” [unclear] guy pushed my dad, and my dad’s kind of
            old. Pushed him or something, and I guess [unclear]. My brother jumped him, and this
            other Indian guy jumped him too. So my dad kicked him and [unclear] from there. I wasn’t
            there. [unclear] attempted murder. <milestone unit="timestamp" start="0:28:35.7"/>

        <p> Yeah, so my brother beat the shit out of him. He almost died, [unclear] assault with
            deadly weapon, ADW. In the county jail here downtown. The county jail. I’d go visit him.
            He was there, like, nine months. My daddy was in there. I couldn’t come up with the bail
            money to get him out, so that was hard for me. [unclear]. He was in there for nine
            months, god. They wouldn’t let him go because they said he was an accessory. So I guess
            my brother talked to the D.A., or what’s his name, whoever that was. I forgot. He said,
            “I want to take the blame for everything. My dad didn’t do it.” He says, “I’ll take the
            whole thing. I don’t care. I’ll go to prison, but I want my dad out of here.” So I guess
            they finally dropped the charges on my dad, let him go. </p>

            here. Me and my mom and dad and—my sister because I know she was born out there. Dang.
            Yeah, she had to be born out there. The rest of the other brothers and sisters, they
            lived out here. I mean, they were born out here. <milestone unit="timestamp"

    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> I don’t think so. Everybody was drinking back there. Everybody was dying out there. </p>

    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>

        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Yeah. And snow. Yeah, that was another thing. So they say, “Go to sunny California, L.A.
            You have to go to L.A. Los Angeles, [unclear], way better.” Yet there was the

    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">

        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Yeah. Yeah, but I liked it. They liked it out there. That’s why we came out here, back

    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">

    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> They always said they were going to visit, but they don’t save up and that. Or they want
            to take us back there, too, to visit our relative. We got a lot of relatives. It never

    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Yeah, I got a sister living out there. My brother, he’s been out there, like, ten,

    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Yeah, I was going to go out there. He told me I could move out there. I was going to do

    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> I changed my mind. No, no, I found work out here. What was I doing? I was doing
            security. That didn’t last. I don’t know. I just got bored with it. No, that’s when I
            got injured, hurt my leg. I was working at night, graveyard. I slipped and fell and
            broke my ankle [unclear], my kneecap. I didn’t see these—they had these [unclear] like a
            gas station. I was security guard there, working eleven to seven or ten to six or
            something like that. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Yeah, I had a flashlight and everything. I didn’t watch where I stepped. I slipped on
            those little pipes. Boy, I went up in the air. Boom! I didn’t think nothing of it. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>
        <p> You came down on your knee. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> Yeah, my right knee here. It was all puffed up. Boy, that hurt. I called them. I told
            that supervisor. He said, “Oh, man, you should have got a lawyer, man. You should have
            sued their asses for that, man. They’re supposed to take you to the hospital right
            there. And you showed them?” I said, “Yeah, my whole knee was all puffed up like that,
            and he just wrote it down.” “Okay” And he just walked away. “Okay, you go home now.’”
            “Oh, man, that ain’t right. You got to get a lawyer, [unclear].” </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>
        <p> Did you sue then? You never sued? <milestone unit="timestamp" start="0:56:40.6"/>
        </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> No, the following day, that’s when I told him. He looked at my leg, the supervisor,
            because I had the key. I couldn’t work. I told him, “My one knee’s messed up.” I told
            him, “I fell down accidentally.” I told the supervisor. He wrote it down in that log.
            “Better get him to the hospital or he can sue us.” “They should have taken you right
            then and there, worker’s comp.” So I got workers’ comp, like, six months. So I just
            stayed home, got a check. I didn’t work or nothing. </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#BAYHYLLE">
        <speaker>BAYHYLLE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> So I was off six months, workers’ comp. I had to go back to work again. They give me the
            runaround and, “Oh, we haven’t found nothing for you. Just be patient.” That went on for
            months. I told them, “I can go back to work Monday.” It was healed up then, but he
            couldn’t find no work. I remember that. Yeah, I almost went out there that one time. He
            was going to fly me there. I never been on a plane either. I’ve been in a helicopter and
            that. [unclear]. I like to fly up. He would pay for my bus, my plane. </p>

        <p> He said, “I’ll get you a job in there.” He said, “I guarantee you’ll get hired,” They
            want to hire you. They hired other people, minorities, but they try to hire our own

    <sp who="#BIG SOLDIER">
        <speaker>BIG SOLDIER</speaker>
        <p> No. I was going to just work out there, but they’re going to put those five more, I
            hear. They’ll have, like, nine casinos up there. Already got four now, I think. Five
            more? He said, “That’s what they’re saying, right out there, I guess.” Chicago,
            Illinois. That didn’t go through, I guess. That’s going to be the biggest casino, way
            bigger than the one in Las Vegas. That’s what I heard. </p>
