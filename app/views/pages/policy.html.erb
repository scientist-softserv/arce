		Openly accessible material is a top priority of the ARCE Archives, which is why we’re digitally
		publishing our Conservation Archives for researchers and the general public alike. With five
		collections published so far, we’re excited to continue the process of digitizing and expanding
		online access to our unique content.

		Collection Information
	</h4>

	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-40 g-mt-20">
		During this initial phase of the Conservation Archives website, ARCE’s priority is providing
		access to five pilot collections within ARCE’s Conservation Archives. Our aim is for these
		newly published collections to be accessible and discoverable for researchers and the general
		public alike. From 2019-2020, the ARCE Archives team focused on processing and describing
		these pilot collections for digital publication. The resulting information contextualizes collection
		material within numerous spheres divided according to location, time period, genre, and subject
		matter, among others. Relevant data fields have been standardized where feasible to increase 
		discoverability within collections. Since our collections cover a geographically, temporally, and
		topically diverse range of conservation work, we outline a few of the data information fields and
		their sources below. 
	</p>

	<h4 class="u-heading-v2__title g-mb-10">
		Description
	</h4>

	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-40 g-mt-20">
		Item descriptions reflect original item titles provided to the Archives by project staff. Minor
		modifications may be made for clarity. 
	</p>

	<h4 class="u-heading-v2__title g-mb-10">
		Topic &amp; Genre
	</h4>

	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-40 g-mt-20">
		The material within the Conservation Archives covers a wide range of subject matter. To
		facilitate user discoverability of our diverse material, we use established controlled vocabularies
		for applying authoritative names and terms as much as possible. For topic terms, our sources
		include the Thesauri and Ontology for documenting Ancient Egyptian Resources, 
		<a href="https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html" alt="Library of
		Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)">
			Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)
		</a>,
		<a href="https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html" alt="Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)">
			the Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)
		</a>, and the 
		<a href="http://viaf.org/" alt="Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)">
			Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)
		</a>
	</p>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-40 g-mt-20">
		For genre terms, we use the 
		<a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/" alt="Getty’s Art & Architecture Thesaurus">
			Getty’s Art & Architecture Thesaurus
		</a>
		. For example, a digitized color slide displaying a wall painting includes “color slide” and 
		“frescoes” within its genre terms. This allows standardized content classification across collections. 
	</p>

	<h4 class="u-heading-v2__title g-mb-10">
		Location
	</h4>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-40 g-mt-20">
		The Conservation Archives consists of heritage sites throughout Egypt. For place names, we use
		<a href="https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html" alt="Library ofCongress Subject Headings (LCSH)">
			Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)
		</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.geonames.org/" alt="Geonames">
			Geonames
		</a>, and the 
		<a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/" alt="Getty Thesaurus for Geographic Names">
			Getty Thesaurus for Geographic Names
		</a>
		. Where applicable, we provide location information at various geographic
		levels. For example, the Aslam al-Silahdar Mosque is located in the Darb al-Ahmar
		neighborhood of Historic Cairo. Location information included therefore reflects its situation
		within Cairo, Egypt, as well as within the Historic Cairo district and the Darb al-Ahmar
		neighborhood. In the future, we aim for site visitors to be able to browse an increasing number of
		collections throughout cities in Egypt as well as throughout relevant districts or neighborhoods,
		such as Historic Cairo. 
	</p>

	<h4 class="u-heading-v2__title g-mb-10">
		Time Period
	</h4>

	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-40 g-mt-20">
		For temporal classification, we consult both the Thesauri and Ontology for documenting Ancient
		Egyptian Resources and 
		<a href="https://perio.do/en/" alt="PeriodO">
			PeriodO
		</a>
		. We include multiple authoritative terms as needed to reflect material that can be classified 
		in more than one historical period. For example, the Shunet elZebib monument is classified under 
		the Early Dynastic Period as well as the 2nd Dynasty of ancient Egyptian history. 
	</p>

	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-40 g-mt-20">

		description. We welcome suggestions and feedback, so please feel free to reach out to the ARCE
