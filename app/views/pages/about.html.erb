		About ARCE
	</h3>

  <p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-40">
		Founded in 1948, the American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE) is a private, non-profit organization composed of educational and cultural institutions, professional scholars, and private individuals. ARCE's mission is to support research on all aspects of Egyptian history and culture, foster a broader knowledge about Egypt among the general public, and strengthen American-Egyptian cultural ties. Over the past 74 years, ARCE has served as a powerful force for conservation, education, and historical research within Egypt. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-40 g-mt-20">
		Our collections cover 7,000 years of Egyptian history, including prehistoric, Pharaonic, Coptic, Islamic, Greco-Roman and more contemporary materials. Housed in the Cairo Center, the Conservation Archives serves as a resource for individuals interested in the dynamics of preserving Egyptian cultural heritage and subject matter covering various fields including but not limited to Egyptology, conservation archaeology, anthropology, art history, Islamic and Coptic studies. The Cairo Center also contains the <a href="https://www.arce.org/library" alt="Marilyn M. and William Kelly Simpson Library">

		ARCE Conservation Archives
	</h3>

	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-40">
		Beginning in the early 1990s, with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), ARCE facilitated vital conservation projects at historic sites and monuments throughout Egypt. The documentation of these projects, showcasing the monument before, during, and after conservation constitutes the unique collections of ARCE’s conservation archives. In total, the Conservation Archives include 79 collections. Each collection contains photographic and textual material, including 35mm and 120mm color and black & white slides, born-digital images, technical reports, maps, drawings, and various grant-related documentation. There are around 70,000 photographic slides, 200,000 images, 1,200 documents, 1,000 drawings, as well as a small selection of artifacts and multimedia content. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-20">
		The Conservation Archives spans 7,000 years of rich Egyptian history, ranging from Pharaonic, Coptic, Islamic, to Greco-Roman. A brief glimpse into the diverse scope of our archives will include Theban tombs, Roman Wall Paintings at Luxor Temple, The Red Monastery in Sohag, and the Bab Zuwayla monument in Historic Cairo. Project work includes conservation, archaeological field training, structural preservation, wall paintings conservation, and historical and archaeological documentation.

		Located on the necropolis of the West Bank of Luxor, the tomb of Anen belonged to an ancient
		Egyptian priest who served under the reign of Amenhotep III. Over time, the tomb had deteriorated
		and the roof caved in, filling the tomb with rubble and subjecting the wall paintings to light, heat,
		and water damage, as well as looters. This project, sponsored by the Royal Ontario Museum, was
		to conserve and protect the tomb of Anen (TT120), as well as the paintings inside.
	</p>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-20">
		In addition to stabilizing and reinforcing the walls of the tomb, the conservators mechanically
		cleaned the reliefs with brushes and scalpels and repaired the mission sections through re-adhered
		fragments with special mortar. Paintings that had been damaged or removed were restored,
		mimicking an ancient painting technique where craftsmen sketched the relief images in red ink
		before filling them with color. The team also constructed a protective display box over the restored
		wall reliefs to protect them from human or environmental damage and built a series of low slanted
		walls along the top edges of the tomb to divert rainwater.<br />

		Luxor Temple was one of the most important political and religious sites during Egypt’s Pharaonic
		period. During the Roman era, parts of the temple were converted into cult chapels and churches.
		This project was initiated to clean and conserve valuable Roman wall paintings at the Luxor
		Temple. The paintings adorn the late 3rd century AD Roman legionary shrine, from the reign of
		Diocletian, within the Luxor Temple. The murals were painted in fresco on lime plaster by a group
		of exceptionally skilled artists who were probably attached to Diocletian's imperial court.
	</p>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-20">
		Project Director Michael Jones and conservators Luigi De Cesaris and Alberto Sucato worked in
		collaboration with Chicago House and the Luxor office of the Ministry of Antiquities.
		Conservation work on the Roman wall paintings was carried out for three full seasons. The project
		highlighted and addressed two important issues: the tragic loss of much of the historically important Roman paintings since John Gardner Wilkinson documented them in the mid-19th
		century; and the dilemma of how to preserve the paintings in the future after the cleaning and
		conservation with an intrusive shelter without compromising the temple.

		the support of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (formerly the Egyptian Supreme
		Council of Antiquities), conducted several site visits to Luxor to extensively document the grounds

	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-20">
		Repairs first began on the exterior of the mosque and the interior was used as a workspace to clean
		and conserve smaller movable components like doors, wooden paneling, metal grilles, and
		windows. A geotechnical survey assessed the mosque’s structural stability and cleaning and
		documentation work began on the exterior façades, roof, dome, and minaret. A new ablution was

		due to water leakage.
	</p>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-20">
		The team removed and replaced decayed stones and cleaned the minaret and dome with micro
		sandblasting. They replaced the wooden roofing and then carefully insulated it against the weather
		and moisture. Inside the mosque, the project plastered and repainted walls, installed new windows,
		and conserved and reinstalled original inlaid doors and wooden paneling. Cracks in the walls were
		consolidated and new brickwork fitted where necessary to reinforce the walls and fill gaps. Finally,

		Talatat blocks, possibly derived from the Arabic word talata meaning “three,” measure roughly three handspans long. Characterized by their Amarna style and smaller size compared to conventional building blocks, they are the result of King Akhenaten’s (1352-1336 BC) goal to urgently erect religious buildings for his “new supreme god” Aten, first in Thebes (ancient Luxor) and later the new city of Akhetaten in Middle Egypt. The talatat blocks were first discovered in the late 19th century and increasingly excavated from then onwards. There are currently approximately 60,000 known blocks, believed to be only a fraction of what exists. 
	</p>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-20">
		The largest repository of talatat blocks resides in the Pennsylvania Magazine in the Karnak Temple complex in Luxor. The Magazine is directly adjacent to the west wall of the Khonsu Temple and stores approximately 16,000 blocks, the majority of which are sandstone (with a few limestone examples). Used to construct temples for the god Aten, the blocks were subsequently dismantled by Akhenaten’s successors, who reused them in other structures. Previously, from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, the blocks were photographed and documented in situ by Akhenaten Temple Project staff, under the auspices of the Penn Museum (also referred to as the University Museum, Pennsylvania).

		From 2008 to 2012, the American Research Center in Egypt (ARCE) Akhenaten Talatat Project Conservation staff cleaned, conserved, photographed, and recorded approximately 16,000 talatat blocks in the Magazine. The blocks had sustained damage which included dangerously leaning stacks; collapsed stacks; dust and bird droppings due to gaps in the roof; hornets’ nests and damage caused by animal burrowing. Matjaž Kačičnik photographed the preliminary conditions of the 28 stacks in the Magazine before project staff proceeded with removing, cleaning, and conserving blocks; some of the shattered blocks were reassembled with steel pins. Documentation included the use of digital photography and database recording. After structural interventions that addressed damage incurred from animal activity and dust accumulation, the blocks were restored in the Pennsylvania Magazine.

		The Tomb of Menna, Theban Tomb number 69, is located in the Theban necropolis of Sheikh Abd el-Qurna in Luxor, Upper Egypt. The rock-cut tomb is famous for the completeness and superb quality of the paintings that adorn its walls. Structurally, the tomb chapel takes the form of an inverted T, with a forecourt, broad hall, and inner hall leading to a statue shrine. The painted decoration is organized symbolically along a central axis that reflected the deceased’s transition from the land of the living in the east to the land of the dead in the west. As such, the walls in the broad hall are concerned primarily with the official duties and celebrations of Menna’s life, while the walls in the long hall depict scenes of his transition to and life in the hereafter.
	</p>
	<p class="g-px-60--md g-mb-20 g-mt-20">
		Menna was an elite official recognized and honored by King Amenhotep III with the Gold of Honor collar, a collar of golden disc-shaped beads, which he wears in most scenes. Menna’s official titles reveal that he was a Scribe, and Overseer of the Fields of the Lord of Two Lands and the Temple of Amun. These titles indicate that Menna administered both state and temple fields, which was an unusual occurrence in the 18th Dynasty. The Broad Hall Near Left wall, abbreviated as BHNL, is also known as the “Agricultural Wall,” and depicts some of Menna’s official responsibilities. Menna’s wife, Henuttawy, appears alongside him on most of the tomb’s walls and bore the titles of “Chantress of Amun” and “Mistress of the House.” Also notable is the intentional damage inflicted on Menna’s likeness in an act of damnatio memoriae, and later destruction to the name of Amun by the agents of Akhenaten.

		The project, directed by Dr. Melinda Hartwig, set an unprecedented standard for the conservation and non-invasive documentation of ancient Egyptian tombs. Dr. Hartwig led an interdisciplinary team of experts that undertook the conservation, archaeometric examination, and digital recording of the tomb. The project resulted in an invaluable collection of high-resolution, digital images that were stitched together to create an exact copy of the tomb walls, which were then traced as vector drawings to create line drawings of the decoration. The collection also includes reports, slides, and digital images shot with raking light and ultraviolet light.
